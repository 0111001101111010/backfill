Commandments of Github
----------------

1. NEVER push to any Main repositories. Only push to your fork. NEVER push upstream.

2. Before starting work on anything run git pull upstream

3. If you have conflicts step away from the computer and ask for help.

4. Create a branch for each task before starting
	
		git checkout -b new_branch

		when done:
			git checkout master
			git merge new_branch

5. Run git status often. If you have error, ask for help.
